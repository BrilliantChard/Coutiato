# 🎓 Coutiato Software App Project

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many, if not all, students transitioning from secondary to tertiary education struggle to choose the right course that fits their skills, passions, and academic strengths. As a result, some end up enrolling in programs that do not align with their interests or abilities, leading to low performance, lack of motivation, and even dropping out.

## 🎯 Objective

To **design a smart software application** that helps students discover the **right course (a maximum of 2 options)** that suits them best — academically and personally — ensuring they make informed and fulfilling career decisions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - The student enters their **cluster points**.
   - Selects the **subjects** they pursued in secondary school.
   - The app filters eligible courses based on this academic input.

2. **Preference Matching:**
   - The app asks the student what they **enjoy doing** or their **career interests**.
   - These preferences are matched against the course options using an **AI model**.

3. **AI-Powered Suggestion:**
   - The trained model analyzes both academic and personal input to **predict the best-fitting course(s)** (maximum of two).
   - The app explains:
     - **Why** the recommended course(s) were selected.
     - **What** is expected from the course.
     - **Relevant industries** one can work in.
     - **Estimated pay** and career growth.
     - **Skills required** to stand out in the field.

4. **Final Output:**
   - A bold and encouraging **congratulatory message** is displayed, celebrating the student’s choice and future.
